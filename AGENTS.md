## Project

Tidal is a Solana DeFi product whose design thesis is **ComfyUI for DeFi**: a visual, typed, composable canvas where users build yield strategies as node graphs and an AI agent composes graphs on their behalf.

The live product is a single unified **workspace** experience. A workspace combines:

- a React Flow node canvas (the composition surface — the product)
- per-workspace chat transcript and chat history (one input modality, not the source of truth)
- active investments panel
- discovery/recommendation panel
- node catalog panel
- template gallery panel (first-class shareable workflows, not a placeholder)

Multiple workspaces are available as tabs in the header. Workspace URLs are top-level routes like `/<workspaceId>`.

## Required Reading

Before making product or architecture decisions, read in order:

1. `docs/design-thesis.md` — foundational. Names the ComfyUI paradigm and its implications.
2. `docs/tidal-prd.md` (v2.2+) — feature roadmap organized around the paradigm.
3. `docs/architecture.md` — current architecture and backend layer plan.

Reject requests that bypass the typed-graph mental model. The graph is the source of truth; chat is one input.

## Hard Constraints

- All product data must be mocked.
- Do not add external API calls for product data.
- Do not add blockchain, RPC, Solana program, or wallet-adapter connections.
- Do not add real wallet integrations.
- Do not import live code from `_archive/`.
- Use Bun for commands and package changes.

## Commands

Use:

- `bun install`
- `bun run dev`
- `bun run lint`
- `bun run build`
- `bun add <package>`
- `bunx <tool>`

Do not use `npm install`, `npm run`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `npx` in this repo.

## Live Architecture

Key docs:

- `docs/architecture.md`: current live architecture.
- `README.md`: developer overview.
- `docs/product-vision.md`: product vision.
- `docs/product-strategy.md`: product strategy.
- `_archive/README.md`: archive rules.

Live code is organized around:

- `src/app`: thin Next.js routes and global shell.
- `src/components/ui`: generic primitives.
- `src/components/tidal`: branded Tidal UI and app-frame components.
- `src/components/workspace`: the only live product area.
- `src/providers`: mocked client state.
- `src/hooks/workspace`: canvas and graph interaction behavior.
- `src/lib/workspace`: pure graph, picker, and status helpers.
- `src/mock-data`: mocked shell and workspace data.

## Workspace Rules

- Keep route files thin.
- Keep workspace product UI under `src/components/workspace`.
- Keep branded reusable components under `src/components/tidal`.
- Keep generic primitives product-agnostic under `src/components/ui`.
- Keep mocked content in `src/mock-data` where practical.
- Prefer prop/data boundaries that will be easy to replace with production adapters later.

## Graph Rules

The graph uses React Flow.

- `WorkspaceNodeOutput.asset` is canonical asset identity for compatibility checks.
- `WorkspaceNodeOutput.amountLabel` is display text.
- Edge `data.asset` is a display label.
- Do not store values like `50% SOL` in `output.asset`; use `asset: "SOL"` and `amountLabel: "50% SOL"`.

The React Flow canvas is intentionally loaded client-only in `workspace-screen.tsx` with SSR disabled. Do not re-enable SSR for the canvas unless hydration has been tested.

## Archive Rules

`_archive/` contains frozen reference code from older Home, Pool, Swap, Global Chat, Amplify, and promotion experiments. It is excluded from the live build and should not be treated as current architecture.

You may read `_archive/` for patterns, but copy any useful pattern into the live workspace structure rather than importing from archive.

## Docs Maintenance

When structural frontend changes are made:

- update `docs/architecture.md`
- update `README.md` if developer-facing orientation changes
- update `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` if AI guidance changes

## Backend Integration Phase (Active)

The frontend prototype is complete. The repo is evolving into a working product per `docs/tidal-prd.md` (v2.1). Backend integration is now in scope.

### Scope Of The Hard Constraints Above

The "no external API calls / no blockchain / no wallet integrations" rules apply to **workspace UI and mock-data patterns**. They do not block the backend layer. Specifically:

- Workspace UI continues to consume data through `src/providers/*` boundaries.
- `src/mock-data/*` stays as the seed/fallback path and source of truth for UI-facing types.
- New adapters slot behind existing providers so the partner's UI keeps working as real calls come online.
- UI components must not import SDK clients directly — route through providers or API routes.

### Backend Layout

- `src/lib/solana/*` — protocol adapters (Kamino, Jupiter Lend, Jito, Sanctum, Jupiter swap, registry, connection)
- `src/lib/ai/*` — Vercel AI SDK v6 tools, prompts, Solana tool definitions
- `src/app/api/*` — route handlers (`chat`, `yields`, `solana/rates`, `solana/positions`)

Keep route handlers thin. Business logic belongs in `src/lib/*`.

### Stack Additions

- **Wallet/Auth:** Privy with `walletChainType: 'ethereum-and-solana'`
- **AI:** Vercel AI SDK v6 + Claude (default to latest Claude 4.x)
- **Swaps:** Jupiter Ultra API direct (`/order` → `/execute`, Beam relayer)
- **Lending:** `@kamino-finance/klend-sdk`, Jupiter Lend API
- **Staking:** Jito stake pool SDK, Sanctum router
- **Yield Data:** DeFi Llama Yields API (filter `chain === "Solana"`)

Confirm exact package names against the PRD before installing.

### Out Of Scope (Parked From v1)

Do not re-introduce without approval: EVM chain configs (Base/Arbitrum/Optimism), Li.Fi SDK, AAVE V3 adapters, ERC-4626 vault adapter, wagmi hooks.

### Testing

- Mainnet with small amounts. Kamino, Jupiter, and Jito lack reliable devnet deployments.
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or RPC URLs with embedded auth. Use `.env.local`.
