# Checkpoint

**Last updated:** 2026-04-20
**Branch:** main (clean, pushed to origin)
**Latest commit:** `09f3139` — feat(solana): JitoSOL adapter reads + positions API route (P2 part 1)

---

## Where We Are

Phase 1 (Composition Foundation + Two Protocols) is in flight. Docs locked. **Privy Solana smoke test PASSED** on 2026-04-20 — all 4 gates cleared (page init, login, Solana wallet provisioned, signMessage returned a valid signature). Phase 1 foundation is de-risked; every downstream signing flow can build on this.

JitoSOL read path is live end-to-end (`/api/solana/positions` returns real data from Helius RPC). Next substantive work is the P2 write path: real `readRate` from Jito stake pool state, and `buildTransaction` for stake/unstake.

**ComfyUI-for-DeFi** remains the foundational design thesis. Agent is a *composer*, not an executor. See `docs/design-thesis.md`.

## Session Work (2026-04-18 and 2026-04-19)

### Docs committed

1. `c3a7838` — Backend integration phase marked in `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/architecture.md`. Scoped existing frontend constraints to UI/mock-data patterns.
2. `c2bf241` — Same phase-shift in `AGENTS.md`.
3. `5c1a8b4` — Claude Code skills list in `CLAUDE.md`.
4. `e9333ac` — New `docs/design-thesis.md` naming ComfyUI paradigm.
5. `8ecc574` — PRD restructured to v2.2 around composition paradigm. Phase 1 now covers composition engine (E1-E6) + 2 adapters + AI + comfort baseline.
6. `7aaaaa1` — `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` cite thesis as required reading.
7. `5315452` — First checkpoint at paradigm pivot.
8. `26596a6` — `docs/phase-1-plan.md` with critical path, week-by-week, decisions to resolve, test plan, risks.

### Code committed

9. `31a389a` — **E5 ProtocolAdapter scaffolding**. `src/lib/solana/types.ts` + `registry.ts`. Pure TypeScript contract. Every adapter binds to a `NodeCatalogItem.id` and implements `readPosition` / `readRate` / `buildTransaction`. Registry is in-memory.
10. `48d8d09` — **P1 Privy wiring**. Installed `@privy-io/react-auth@3.22.1` + Solana peers (`@solana/kit`, `@solana-program/{system,token,memo}`). Created `src/components/providers/privy-provider.tsx` with Tidal dark theme + Solana embedded/external wallets. Wired at outermost layer in `layout.tsx`. Added `/privy-smoke` debug page exercising login, wallet listing, and `signMessage` on first Solana wallet.
11. `8e51d8b` — **GraphMutation + workflow schema** (A2/E3 prep). `src/lib/workspace/mutations.ts` discriminated-union mutations + pure `applyMutations` fold. `src/lib/workspace/workflow-schema.ts` for `tidal.workflow.v1` export/import.
12. `c31d73d` — **Solana RPC connection factory**. `src/lib/solana/connection.ts` with `server-only` guard, cached `createSolanaRpc` bound to `HELIUS_RPC_URL`.
13. `09f3139` — **JitoSOL adapter reads + positions API route** (P2 part 1). Real `readPosition` via `getTokenAccountsByOwner`. Stub `readRate`. `buildTransaction` throws until smoke test clears (it has now). `/api/solana/positions` wires the adapter pattern end-to-end. Verified working on 2026-04-20.

### Key decisions locked

- **Single repo** — evolving the prototype into the working product. No fork.
- **ComfyUI framing** — every product/arch decision goes through the typed-graph filter.
- **Server-side tx build** — adapters run in `src/app/api/*`, client just signs returned base64 tx. Keeps RPC key server-only.
- **Env var naming** (locked): `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID` (public by design), `PRIVY_APP_SECRET` (server-only), `HELIUS_RPC_URL` (server-only). `.env*` gitignored (`.gitignore:35`).
- **RPC provider**: Helius free tier.
- **No substantive design changes** — reuse existing primitives from `src/components/ui` and `src/components/tidal`. 0xJulo's frontend architecture stays intact.
- **Minimal 0xJulo asks**: (1) review 6-asset color palette, (2) "graph appears" animation preference (or ship "just appear" for MVP).
- **Agent's role** — composer, not executor. Tools return `GraphMutation[]` which the client applies to `WorkspaceProvider`.

### Package decisions

- Privy 3.22.1 — uses `@privy-io/react-auth/solana` subpath for `useWallets`, `useSignMessage`, `useSignTransaction`, `toSolanaWalletConnectors`
- `@solana/kit` 6.x (modern replacement for `@solana/web3.js`) — new Solana toolkit
- `@solana-program/{system,token,memo}` — program bindings per the new SDK pattern

## Current Repo State

### Frontend (complete, 0xJulo)

Unchanged from last checkpoint. Tree is: `TooltipProvider` (now nested under `PrivyProvider`) → `PreferenceProfileProvider` → `WorkspaceProvider` → `SidePanelProvider`.

### Backend (in progress)

- `src/lib/solana/types.ts` — `ProtocolAdapter` interface + supporting types
- `src/lib/solana/registry.ts` — `registerAdapter` / `getAdapter` / `listAdaptersByRiskTier` / `clearAdaptersForTesting`
- `src/components/providers/privy-provider.tsx` — configured for Solana
- `src/app/privy-smoke/page.tsx` — debug smoke-test page (remove after verified)

Still empty: `src/lib/ai/*`, `src/app/api/*`.

## Next Session Starts Here

### Immediate next work

**P2 write path (JitoSOL stake/unstake):**

1. Replace stub `readRate` in `src/lib/solana/jito.ts` with real APY computation — either from Jito stake pool account state (exchange rate delta over epochs) or from Jito's public yield endpoint
2. Implement `buildTransaction` for JitoSOL stake pool `depositSol` instruction and unstake/withdraw path. Returns base64-encoded `VersionedTransaction`.
3. Add `/api/solana/build-transaction` route that takes catalogItemId + wallet + widgets, calls `adapter.buildTransaction`, returns the tx
4. Client flow: user clicks Run on node → hit build-transaction → Privy `useSignTransaction` signs → submit via `sendTransaction` RPC → poll status
5. Mainnet smoke test: stake 0.01 SOL from the same wallet that passed the smoke test, verify the transaction lands on Solana mainnet
6. LiteSVM unit tests for `buildTransaction` output shape

### Parallel side tracks (can ship anytime)

- **E4 type-colored edges** (CSS + React Flow edge styling; palette defaults approved)
- **A2 `composeStrategy` tool shape** — draft the AI SDK v6 tool that returns `GraphMutation[]`. Pairs with the `GraphMutation` work already committed.
- **Consider bumping tsconfig target** from ES2017 → ES2022 (enables bigint literals, cleaner async, modern syntax across backend). Low-risk one-liner commit.

### Parallel side tracks (can start anytime)

- **E4 type-colored edges** (pure frontend, awaits color palette from 0xJulo)
- **E3 prep**: draft `tidal.workflow.v1` JSON schema spec
- **A2 prep**: design `GraphMutation` type + `applyMutations` helper in `src/lib/workspace/` — unblocks the agent's composition-mode tools

### Decisions still to resolve

- Signing UX sheet design (0xJulo, needed before Week 3 E6 lands) — minimal: assemble from existing Sheet/Dialog primitives, so this is implementation more than design
- Asset color palette (10-min review by 0xJulo)
- "Graph appears" animation (10-min decision, fine to ship "just appear")

### Risks (updated)

1. ~~Privy Solana embedded wallet maturity~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-04-20 by smoke test**
2. Kamino SDK docs quality — test when we get to P3 in Week 3
3. AI SDK v6 tool-call → graph mutation pattern — `GraphMutation` type and `applyMutations` helper are committed; still need to prove the wire with a hello-world AI tool
4. Mainnet testing costs time — budgeted
5. **New:** Privy `signTransaction` hook behavior — `signMessage` works, but full Solana transaction signing + submission may surface additional quirks. De-risk early in P2 write path.
