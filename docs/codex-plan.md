# Codex Plan

## Objective

Restructure the frontend so that:

- visual styling is reusable and consistent
- mocked state and view logic are separated from presentational components
- feature experimentation can continue without turning page files into one-off UI builds
- another developer can later connect the real app logic without having to untangle styling and screen composition first

This repo remains a prototype repo. No external integrations, wallet logic, blockchain calls, or real data plumbing should be introduced here.

## Current Assessment

The repo is in a workable prototype state, but the frontend is still organised more like a design spike than a clean handoff layer.

What is already good:

- a small codebase that is still easy to refactor
- a shared primitive UI layer under `src/components/ui`
- a theme and brand token base in `src/app/globals.css`
- early separation between generic UI and Amplify-specific UI

What currently needs work:

- page files own too much UI composition, mock content, and styling
- feature data is embedded directly in components
- branded Tidal patterns are not yet captured as reusable design components
- screen styling relies heavily on long inline Tailwind strings
- visual consistency exists at the color level more than at the component/system level
- some basic hygiene issues remain, such as lint failures and default scaffold docs

## Target Shape

The frontend should be structured around responsibility-first folders:

### 1. Generic UI primitives

Reusable low-level building blocks with no product meaning.

Examples:

- `Button`
- `Input`
- `Card`
- `DropdownMenu`
- `Sidebar`

Location:

- `src/components/ui`

### 2. Tidal design components

Reusable branded product-facing building blocks built on top of the primitives.

Examples:

- `PromptComposer`
- `SuggestionChip`
- `SectionHeader`
- `WorkspaceButton`
- `ProtocolBadge`
- `StrategyNodeCard`
- `ChatMessageBubble`
- `ModeSelect`

Location:

- `src/components/tidal`

### 3. Product-area UI components

UI and screen composition that only belongs to one Tidal product area.

Examples:

- Pool screen composition
- Swap screen composition
- Amplify graph screen composition
- Home global-chat composition
- Shell frame components

Location:

- `src/components/shell`
- `src/components/home`
- `src/components/pool`
- `src/components/swap`
- `src/components/amplify`

### 4. Providers, hooks, and frontend helpers

Local mocked state, React behaviour, and pure helpers should live outside UI folders.

Examples:

- global chat workspace provider
- Pool workspace provider
- Amplify workspace provider
- Amplify canvas state hook
- Amplify graph and picker utilities
- route builders

Location:

- `src/providers`
- `src/hooks`
- `src/lib`

### 5. Mock data containers

Prototype data grouped by product area, plus the lightweight types that describe it.

Examples:

- Pool screen composition
- Swap screen composition
- Amplify graph screen composition
- mocked recommendations
- mocked chat transcripts
- mocked strategy graph data

Location:

- `src/mock-data/pool`
- `src/mock-data/swap`
- `src/mock-data/amplify`

## Recommended Folder Structure

```text
src/
  app/
  components/
    ui/
    tidal/
    shell/
    home/
    pool/
    swap/
    amplify/
  providers/
  hooks/
    amplify/
  lib/
    amplify/
    routes/
  mock-data/
    shell/
      types.ts
      *.ts
    home/
      types.ts
      *.ts
    pool/
      types.ts
      *.ts
    swap/
      types.ts
      *.ts
    amplify/
      types.ts
      *.ts
```

Notes:

- `ui/` stays generic and reusable across any app
- `tidal/` holds shared branded patterns that represent the design system of this product
- `components/{shell,home,pool,swap,amplify}` holds product-area UI and screen composition
- `providers/` holds local mocked prototype state contexts
- `hooks/` holds reusable React behaviour
- `lib/` holds pure utilities, product-area helpers, and route builders
- `mock-data/` owns prototype content grouped by product area, with a flat `types.ts` plus mock data files in each product-area folder
- `src/app/globals.css` is the central home for theme tokens, semantic typography, layout helpers, and shared React Flow styling

## Component Boundary Rules

These rules should guide the cleanup:

### Presentational components

Presentational components should:

- receive data via props
- render UI only
- avoid owning feature-specific mock data
- avoid direct knowledge of routes, data sources, or execution logic
- encapsulate repeated styling patterns

Examples:

- a chat composer
- a protocol card
- a strategy node shell
- a suggestion chip row

### Container components

Container components should:

- assemble screens
- import mock data
- hold temporary prototype state
- translate mock data into presentational props
- remain easy to replace later when real integration happens

Examples:

- home screen container
- amplify workspace container
- pool recommendation screen container

### Product-area UI folders

Product-area UI folders should:

- own screen-level composition for that area
- contain feature-specific components that are not generic enough for `components/tidal`
- keep product-area responsibilities easy to find
- avoid owning providers, hooks, pure helpers, mock data, backend clients, or blockchain integration code

Examples:

- `components/amplify/amplify-workspace.tsx`
- `components/amplify/*-node.tsx`
- `components/shell/app-sidebar.tsx`

### Mock data modules

Mock data should:

- live outside UI component files
- be typed
- be grouped by feature
- be easy to swap out later with real app data

## Styling Direction

The styling work should focus on systemising the current look rather than redesigning the product from scratch.

### Keep

- current Tidal palette and dark visual direction
- Tailwind + token approach
- existing generic primitive layer

### Improve

- keep the styling system centred in `src/app/globals.css`
- define semantic typography styles
- define consistent spacing and panel rules
- define reusable component variants with `cva`
- reduce long one-off class strings in page files
- make branded patterns reusable instead of copy-pasted
- improve responsive behaviour on the main layouts

### Suggested design tokens to formalise

- typography: `display`, `heading`, `title`, `body`, `caption`, `label`
- surfaces: `page`, `panel`, `card`, `elevated-card`, `interactive-card`
- spacing: shared section gaps and panel paddings
- borders: panel, muted, active, emphasis
- radii: input, card, pill, modal
- motion: standard transitions for hover, menu open, panel collapse

- [x] Split Amplify into a blank builder workspace and a separate example workspace, with sidebar switching handled by shared Amplify state.
- [x] Add a direct Home CTA that creates a blank Amplify workspace without requiring a chat prompt first.
- [x] Expand the Amplify graph schema to support discriminated node kinds, asset compatibility metadata, output streams, and execution snapshots.
- [x] Add the first real Amplify builder interactions: drag-from-output creation, compatibility-aware node picking, right-click canvas creation, and graph persistence.
- [x] Add Phase 5 inline node editing, reward-routing-aware compatibility checks, and draft-vs-active locking for Amplify strategies.
- [x] Add Phase 6 mocked run validation, node-level error states, active snapshot preservation, and downstream impact banners for Amplify strategies.
- [x] Add Phase 7 workspace polish including fullscreen canvas focus mode, header/chat hiding, and documentation updates for Amplify.
- [x] Replace the flat Amplify node picker with a shared tabbed picker using hybrid categories, search, and disabled constrained states.
- [x] Give Amplify workspaces addressable `/amplify/[workspaceId]` URLs and route all sidebar/Home entry points to the selected workspace.
- [x] Refactor Amplify back toward the earlier hygiene bar by splitting mock-data concerns, extracting canvas graph state into `src/hooks/amplify`, and deleting dead node paths.
- [x] Standardise ownership and promotion UI across Home, Pool, and Amplify with shared banners, summary panels, and promotion cards.
- [x] Remove the redundant `src/features` layer and split its contents into product-area components, providers, hooks, and lib helpers.
- [ ] Decide the first real Swap screen to add under the product-area component structure.
- [x] Continue replacing raw text sizes and page spacing values with the new semantic classes in `globals.css`.
- [x] Decide the intentional mobile layout behaviour for Amplify.
- [x] Document the semantic styling conventions now living in `globals.css`.

### Success Criteria

- [x] page files are thin and mostly declarative
- [x] mock data is not embedded in UI component files
- [x] shared branded components exist for repeated Tidal patterns
- [x] product-area UI lives in `components/{shell,home,pool,swap,amplify}` while providers, hooks, helpers, and mock data live outside UI folders
- [x] styling decisions are encoded in reusable components and variants
- [x] another developer can connect real logic without rewriting the visual layer
- [x] the repo remains lightweight and prototype-friendly

### Non-Goals

- [ ] build real backend or blockchain integrations
- [ ] add production-grade business logic
- [ ] over-engineer a full enterprise design system
- [ ] eliminate all local prototype state

The target is a clean, handoff-friendly prototype frontend, not a production app.
